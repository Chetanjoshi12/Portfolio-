          I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics and a Diploma in Professional
          Accounting. My interest in IT led me to complete a 6-month internship
          at Keen and Able, Noida, where I gained hands-on experience. I later
          worked as a contractor with the same company, further refining my
          technical skills.
